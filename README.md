# school-mangement-demo-php

This PHP project is designed to manage school events using a SQL database. It was developed as part of educational plans and includes four main entities: `etablissement`, `ecole`, `orienteur`, and `evenement`. The project is entirely in French as it aims to help students learn not only CRUD operations but also how to connect to a database and use PDO to run SQL statements.

## Features

- **CRUD for Ecoles**: Add, edit, delete, and display ecoles.
- **CRUD for Orienteurs**: Add, edit, delete, and display orienteurs.
- **CRUD for Evenements**: Add, edit, delete, and display evenements.
